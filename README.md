## Usage

Go to the home page and add a project by giving it a name, description, link to a photo, and the number of days you would like to give yourself to complete the project.  Add some items to the project by filling in a description, link to a photo, and category (optional).  You can update or delete an item at any point if you need to by clicking on the icons at the top of each item card.

After you have completed adding all your items to the project, start inviting some friends to help you out by clicking the 'Ask Friend' button.  They will be sent a link to the project page where they can view your project with all the items, and can vote on whether you should keep or let go of each item.

At the end of the project you will be able to see the tally of the up votes and down votes for each item, and according to

## Planned New Features

* User could select a category to disposition each item e.g. Keep, Donate, Give to Friend, Sell, Throw Away, etc.
